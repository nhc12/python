# python-homework Remarks (PyBank)
* Introduced a new column to easily reflect the variances for the purpose of the assignment (*'Change'* Column)
* Used pandas functionalities to process all calculations (*i.e Count, Sum, Mean, Max, Min*)
* For *Greatest increase and decrease* in profits and losses respecitvely, used Max and Min with boolean selection to find the month and the value required
* Took inspiration from the below sources:
  * https://datatofish.com/use-pandas-to-calculate-stats-from-an-imported-csv-file/

* I will appreciate your feedback on how to perform this excercise, this is a very new experience for me (I dont have any coding background).
